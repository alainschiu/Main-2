For what it's worth, in my best effort, I have never tried to change you, at least the person you are. I have always treated you with respect, and want you to have the best of what you can be. If that came up as me trying to change you then you are mistaken and I am very sorry that you feel this way. But in my all honesty, I did my best and yes perhaps we have been slacking the past year, I did all that I could to make you feel treasured and respected. So to be very frank, I don't think what you said was the real reason we grew apart.  What do you want in life then, you have not told me. Is that something we can work on together? Again, there is this lack of communication from your end that is making me feel very left out. 
As much as I respect you all along, I respect your decision. But please try to be frank
